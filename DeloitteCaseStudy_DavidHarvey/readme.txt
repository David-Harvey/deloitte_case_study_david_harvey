Software Engineer Technical Case Study - By David Harvey

This app will require you to run it using Windows with .NET 4.5.2 installed or greater.

There are two ways to run this application:

1.	Via command line 
2.	Visual Studio 2017 


Command line:

I have purposely committed the 'bin\release\' directory in Github so you do not need to build it using Visual Studio.

Clone the GitHub repository and navigate to the directory using Command Line.

Execute the following command: DeloitteCaseStudy_DavidHarvey.exe .\sampledata.txt 

Alternatively you can provide an alternative source of sample data. This can be in the form of a relative, or full path.

Visual Studio 2017:

Open solution from root project directory
Build 
Run or debug using either release/debug configurations.
